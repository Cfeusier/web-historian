# Web Historian - Archive.org Clone

This is a project I completed during a two-day sprint while studying at [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com). This app was built with a pair, using vanilla Node (http module, fs module, url module, and path module) and CRON. The objective of this project was to build a feature-complete web historian using vanilla Node, with a focus on building a CORS capbable HTTP server.
